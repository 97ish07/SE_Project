    <p>As of my last update in January 2022, Facebook's "Poke" feature has been around for quite some time.<br>
         It's a simple feature that allows users to interact with each other in a playful or flirtatious manner. <br>
         When you "poke" someone on Facebook, they receive a notification informing them that you've poked them. <br>
         They can then choose to poke you back, ignore the poke, or simply leave it unanswered.<br><br><br>

        The exact purpose or meaning behind poking someone on Facebook has evolved over time and varies between individuals. <br>
        Originally, it was meant as a lighthearted way to get someone's attention or to simply acknowledge their presence. However,<br>
         its significance has become somewhat ambiguous, and people may interpret it differently based on context and personal relationships.<br>
        
        In essence, poking someone on Facebook doesn't do much besides sending them a notification and potentially sparking some interaction or <br>
        conversation between the two parties involved. It's more of a social gesture than a functional feature with a specific purpose</p>
