    width: 1200px; ">As of my last update in January 2022, Facebook's "Poke" feature has been around for quite some time.
         It's a simple feature that allows users to interact with each other in a playful or flirtatious manner. 
         When you "poke" someone on Facebook, they receive a notification informing them that you've poked them. 
         They can then choose to poke you back, ignore the poke, or simply leave it unanswered.<br><br>

        The exact purpose or meaning behind poking someone on Facebook has evolved over time and varies between individuals. 
        Originally, it was meant as a lighthearted way to get someone's attention or to simply acknowledge their presence. However,
         its significance has become somewhat ambiguous, and people may interpret it differently based on context and personal relationships.
        
        In essence, poking someone on Facebook doesn't do much besides sending them a notification and potentially sparking some interaction or
        conversation between the two parties involved. It's more of a social gesture than a functional feature with a specific purpose</p>
